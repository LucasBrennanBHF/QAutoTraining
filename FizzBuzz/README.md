## **FizzBuzz**

The goal of this project is to generate a list of numbers from 1 to 100 (However should be able to go as high as the user wants) and then to output that list of numbers.

In this output any number that is divisible by 3 the number is replaced with the word "Fizz"

Any number divisible by 5 the number is replaced by the word "Buzz"

And Any number divisible by both 3 and 5 is replaced by the word "FizzBuzz"

Bellow is an example of what the inputs and outputs should look like up to the number 15

``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ```

``` 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz 6 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz ```

This project will make use of if statements and loops bellow is some helpful documentation to get started
