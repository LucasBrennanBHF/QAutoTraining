## **Caesar Cipher**

The Caesar Cipher is an algorithm which takes a line of text and encrypts it by shifting the letters by a number down the alphabet.

For example, if the shift value was 3 the letter A would become the Letter D.

The algorithm should also be able to decrypt a line of text back into its original text.

Using the same example if the shift value was 3 then the letter D should become the letter A

If in the case the letter Z was used it would wrap around to the start so Z would become C

An example of what a line of text should become, note Capital letters should remain capital and lower case should remain lowercase

This algorithm makes use of quite a few C# concepts such as Loops, string manipulation, selection statements and collections all together 

Here is some helpful documentation to get you started

- [C# Selection Statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/selection-statements)
- [C# Loops](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements)
- [C# Collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/collections)
- [C# OOP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop)

Other helpful information / Tips

- You'll be using a nested loop (loops inside of loops)
- You'll get an error message if you don't account for the the end of the alphabet and it wrapping around (if the shift goes past Z)
- Its best to break the problem down and work in increments and solve one thing at a time - you can use your ticket, this readme file or slacknotes to help with this
