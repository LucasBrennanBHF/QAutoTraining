## **Simple Calculator**

This simple calculator is intended to have 4 functions. Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide. The user gives two numbers and the calculator returns the value from that operation

While not neesarry having user input for operator and chosing the operation based on that could be an extra challenge 

This intention of this is to get used to different methods and simple operations. As well as the difference for integer division

Bellow is some helpful documentation to get started

## **Advanced Calculator**

This builds off what was done previously in the simple calculator with some more complex operations. These are Square, Area of a Rectangle, Area of a Triangle and Area of a circle.

The intention of this is is to use polymorphism as the advanced calculator should be able to do everything the simple calculator can without repeating the methods.
