## **Coffee Shop**

The coffee shop is a program which takes a text input for a coffee order and returns a Coffee which the desired ingredents

For example: user inputs milk and 2 sugars

The coffee returned should contain milk and 2 sugars, however a Coffee Order needs to be made by a customer and a coffee machine should make the coffee before returning it.

The goal of this is to start using Object orinted programming as well as following SOLID principles as this will make use of different classes and interfaces as well as creating methods for those.

Some Peusdocode has also been written to help understand what the Main method is doing in this program 

More info about SOLID will be bellow however our main focus should be that each class should only have one responsibilty and that we should be using our interfaces where we can

Here is some helpful documentation to get you started

- [C# Selection Statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/selection-statements)
- [C# Collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/collections)
- [C# Methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/methods)
- [C# OOP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop)
- [SOLID principles](https://stackify.com/solid-design-principles/)

Helpful advice before getting started 

- Interfaces have already been made so youll just need to create the classes for the interfaces
- Breaking down the problem here will be quite useful
