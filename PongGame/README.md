## **Pong**

Please do this project **Last** as it uses concepts from all the other projects and more

The goal of this project is to fix a broken version of Pong, where the Paddles and the Ball do not move 

There are some behaviors the ball and paddles should have:

- The ball and paddle cannot go off the screen
- If the ball hits the top or bottom of the screen it should bounce back
- If the paddle hits the top of bottom of the screen it should remain there
- Paddles are controlled by the user, Player1 uses W and S to move up and down, Player2 uses up arrow and down arrow
- The ball should move on its own in a diagonal direction
 
 This project makes use of some more complex logic as well as OOP, Selection statements, Nested Selection statements and Concepts in earlier projects.

This is an open ended task and there is no one way which is correct, due to that there's not much documentation that will help that hasn't already been covered but these inparticular will help

- [C# Selection Statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/selection-statements)
- [C# Loops](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements)
- [C# Collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/collections)
- [C# OOP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop)


Here is some advice to help get started

- The only parts that need editing are in the folder called Game entities
- Look around other classes and methods as they can give you some idea of how things work
- Areas where you need to edit have been marked as such
- Investigating KeyboardListener and Screen bounds should help in some cases (These are not in the Game Entities folder)
- Breaking down the problem here is also beneficial it is already broken down above but can be done further
 
Be sure to ask any questions and work with other QAs, While there are unit tests for this the best way to check if its working is to play it yourself
