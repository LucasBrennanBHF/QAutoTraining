## **QAUTO - Training Projects**

This repo consists of 4 projects to help aid in Automation training and give an understanding of C# concepts.

This will also be done with other resources such as sololearn which ill be outlined in the QAUTO ticket.

This readme will give a brief outline of each project and the recommended order to do them in

1. [Simple & Advanced Calculator](https://github.com/LucasBrennanBHF/QAutoTraining/tree/main/Simple%20Calculator) - A small step up to create a working calculator and then upgrade that to an advanced calculator
2. [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/LucasBrennanBHF/QAutoTraining/tree/main/FizzBuzz) - A simple algorithm which turns any number divisible by 3 into "Fizz", divisible by 5 into "Buzz" and divisible by both into "FizzBuzz"
3. [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/LucasBrennanBHF/QAutoTraining/tree/main/Caesar%20Cipher) - To create a working cipher program that can encrypt and decrypt messages based on a key given
4. [Pong](https://github.com/LucasBrennanBHF/QAutoTraining/tree/main/PongGame) - Given a existing game of pong the goal of this is to finish the game and make the ball and paddle move

Each of these has been given a project and a Skeleton so just the logic needs to be completed, each have unit tests to use as a marker however these will be used along side code reviews to ensure the code is working correctly and up to a good standard.

After these projects are finished and the QAUTO test area is set up you'll move onto making a script for that (wont be added into the suite) then to working on automation tickets

It is also up to you if you want to review the code at the end of each project or after all project. If you have any questions be sure to ask. I also strongly encourage working with other QAs and asking for their help while working through these as there is no one right answer to any of these projects.

Each project will have a Program or Start up file, you can use this to run your code and output it to the console
